# Customer-Satisfaction-Buttons

In the designer section of MIT app inventor, two buttons Good and Bad are created for providing positive and negative feedback respectively.

Labels were also created to count the number of times each button was pressed

As soon as any one of the buttons is pressed the clock timer is enabled. It starts working and 
disables both the buttons for 10 seconds.
